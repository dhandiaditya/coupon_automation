PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION = """
The web app is designed to help Udemy course instructors promote all of their Udemy course coupons for an entire month in just two minutes! Our automation software makes it easy to quickly and efficiently promote their coupons to a wide audience, saving them time and effort without spending a dime!.

This promotion is free of cost. Our automation software will promote your course through various channels, including social media and email marketing, giving you a free and effective way to reach a wider audience.

With our Udemy course promotion automation service, you can increase your revenue by at least two times.

There are only three easy steps to follow:

1. The first step involves downloading the course information from Udemy and uploading the CSV file to the web app. The web app will then provide you with a CSV file that you can download to create coupons for your course.

2. The second step requires you to upload the provided CSV file to Udemy and download the active coupons CSV file from Udemy.

3. In the final step, you need to upload the active coupons CSV file to the web app, and that's it.

By automating the promotion process, the app can help course instructors save time and effort while increasing the visibility of their courses and attracting more potential students. With the app, manual promotion tasks become a thing of the past, and instructors can focus on creating quality courses and leave the promotion to automation.

**This is your new superpower; let's do it**

To get started, you provide us with a CSV file that can be downloaded from Udemy, containing your course information. We then process your data and provide you with a CSV file that you can upload directly to Udemy's platform. Our automation software will then take care of the rest, promoting your course to a wider audience.",
    "What type of information should I include in my Udemy CSV file?": "When you download a CSV file from Udemy, it will contain several columns of information about the courses you are interested in. The following columns are typically included in the CSV file:\n\n\n\n course_id: The unique identifier for each course on Udemy.\n\n course_name: The name of the course.\n\n currency: The currency used for pricing the course on Udemy.\n\n best_price_value: The lowest price at which the course is currently available on Udemy.\n\n min_custom_price: The minimum price that a course instructor has set for the course.\n\n max_custom_price: The maximum price that a course instructor has set for the course.\n\n coupons_remaining: The number of coupons that are still available for the course.\n\n It's important to note that you should not change the column names or their order in the CSV file, as this may cause issues with Udemy's promotion system. However, you can change the number of rows in the CSV file to include as many or as few courses as you'd like.",
    "What types of coupons will be promoted in this automation?": "Only the 'free_open' coupon (1000 coupons, 5 days) type will be promoted in this automation.",
    "How much does your service cost?": "Our service is completely free to use, but if you appreciate the service, you can buy us a coffee as a token of appreciation.",
    "How long does it take to see results from your service?": "You'll be happy to know that you can start seeing the results of our service within just a few hours. It's pretty quick, and we think you'll be pleased with the outcome!",
    "What if I have questions or concerns about your service?": "We pride ourselves on providing excellent customer service and support.
